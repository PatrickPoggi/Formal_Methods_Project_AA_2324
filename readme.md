# FORMAL ANALYSIS OF SEARCH-AND-RESCUE SCENARIOS with UPPAAL

This report explores a real-time simulation of a search and rescue scenario where first responders help civilians escape a fire and reach the exits safely. The rescue operation is aided by drones that patrol the area. The focus of the model is to understand the survival possibilities given different fire and exit layouts, as well as varying numbers of civilians and first responders.

## Content
The project contains the Report.pdf file and the two main XMLs in the main directory. Then it has two sub directories:

-`XMLs/` contains XMLs of an alternative configuration that we tested.

-`script2/` contains a python script that we used to generate maps and to run queries. It is not updated to work with the latest version of our model but we include it as it was useful during map creation and testing. Nonetheless it is still possible to manually copy and paste configurations from the file params_tmp.cfg which is handier than configuring parameters by hand.
